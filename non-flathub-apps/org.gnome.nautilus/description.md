Nautilus, also known as Files, is the default file manager of the GNOME desktop. It provides a simple and integrated way of managing your files and browsing your file system.

Nautilus supports all the basic functions of a file manager and more. It can search and manage your files and folders, both locally and on a network, read and write data to and from removable media, run scripts, and launch applications. It has three views: Icon Grid, Icon List, and Tree List. Its functions can be extended with plugins and scripts.
